## Architecture & Urbanism
Graduated from FAU-USP in 2021, I'm currently working as a Illumination Projects Analist.
My final graduation work was all about women in architecture, and you can check it on my [Issuu page](https://issuu.com/fern_fahl/docs/tfg_representatividade_feminina_na_arquitetura_-_f) (Portuguese version)
